## Drawing mode

Drawing mode lets you freehand draw lines and arrows on the map to show movement paths, sightlines, and tactical information.

### Activating drawing mode

Switch to drawing mode in any of these ways:

- Press `Q` to toggle drawing mode on/off
- Click the drawing tool button in the toolbar
- Press `S` to return to navigation mode

<Note>
  When drawing mode is active, clicking and dragging on the map will create drawings instead of panning the view.
</Note>

### Creating drawings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter drawing mode">
    Press `Q` or click the drawing tool icon.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Draw on the map">
    Click and drag your mouse to create freehand lines. The drawing follows your cursor smoothly.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Release to finish">
    Release the mouse button to complete the drawing. The line is automatically smoothed using the Douglas-Peucker algorithm.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Drawing properties

Customize your drawings with these options:

- **Color**: Select from the color picker to match different team roles or action types
- **Line style**: Toggle between solid and dotted lines
- **Arrow heads**: Add arrows to indicate direction of movement

<Tip>
  Use different colors consistently throughout your strategy. For example, use yellow for entry fraggers, blue for support players, and red for enemy positions.
</Tip>

## Technical details

The drawing system uses coordinate normalization:

- Drawings are stored in normalized coordinates (0-1000 height, aspect-adjusted width)
- Paths are rebuilt when zooming to maintain visual quality
- Smoothing reduces point count while preserving shape
- Bounding boxes enable efficient eraser collision detection

### Path smoothing

When you finish a drawing, Icarus simplifies the path:

1. Raw input points are collected as you draw
2. The Douglas-Peucker algorithm reduces points (epsilon: 1.4)
3. The simplified path is rebuilt using quadratic Bezier curves
4. For single points, a small circle is rendered

## Eraser tool

Remove unwanted drawings with the eraser tool.

### Using the eraser

<Steps>
  <Step title="Activate eraser mode">
    Press `W` to toggle eraser mode on/off.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Erase drawings">
    Click and drag over any drawing to erase it. The eraser detects line segments within its radius.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Return to normal mode">
    Press `W` again or press `S` to return to navigation mode.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The eraser uses line segment distance calculations to detect which drawings to remove:

- Checks if the bounding box is within eraser range
- Calculates distance to each line segment
- Removes entire drawing if any segment is within eraser radius
- Eraser radius is configurable in settings

<Tip>
  The eraser removes entire drawing strokes, not just parts of them. If you need to modify a line, erase it and redraw.
</Tip>

## Undo and redo

All drawing actions support undo/redo:

- **Undo**: Press `Ctrl+Z` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Z` (Mac)
- **Redo**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+Z` or `Cmd+Shift+Z`

Drawing actions are tracked independently from other elements like agents and abilities.

## Interaction states

Icarus uses distinct interaction states:

- **Navigation**: Default mode for panning and selecting elements
- **Drawing**: Active when creating freehand drawings
- **Erasing**: Active when removing drawings

Only one state can be active at a time. Switching states updates the cursor and interaction behavior.
