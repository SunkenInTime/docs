## Creating a new strategy

Strategies are stored locally in your application support directory and can be organized into folders.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch the strategy creator">
    From the main menu, click the create button or use the file menu to start a new strategy.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Name your strategy">
    Enter a descriptive name for your strategy. The name can be changed later by renaming the strategy.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select a map">
    Choose which Valorant map you want to create the strategy for. Available maps include Ascent, Bind, Haven, Split, Icebox, Breeze, Fracture, Pearl, Lotus, Sunset, and Abyss.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start designing">
    Your strategy opens with a single page called "Page 1". You can now start adding agents, abilities, drawings, and other elements to visualize your strategy.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Opening existing strategies

You can load previously saved strategies in several ways:

- **From the library**: Click on any strategy card in your main library view
- **Recent strategies**: Access recently edited strategies from the file menu
- **Drag and drop**: Drag `.ica` files directly into the application window

<Note>
  Strategies are automatically migrated to the latest version when you open them. Legacy strategies created before the multi-page feature will be converted to have a single page.
</Note>

## Organizing with folders

Keep your strategies organized by creating folders:

1. Right-click in the library view to create a new folder
2. Drag strategies into folders to organize them
3. Folders can be nested to create hierarchies
4. Each strategy can belong to one folder at a time

## Auto-save

Icarus automatically saves your work as you create:

- Changes are saved after a brief delay when you stop editing
- The save indicator appears in the UI when saving occurs
- All pages in your strategy are saved together
- You can manually trigger a save from the file menu

<Tip>
  The auto-save delay is configurable in settings. A longer delay reduces disk writes but means more potential data loss if the app crashes.
</Tip>

## Renaming strategies

To rename a strategy:

1. Right-click the strategy in your library
2. Select "Rename" from the context menu
3. Enter the new name and press Enter or click confirm

You can also rename the active strategy from the file menu while editing.

## Duplicating strategies

Create a copy of an existing strategy:

1. Right-click the strategy you want to duplicate
2. Select "Duplicate" from the context menu
3. A new strategy is created with " (Copy)" appended to the name

The duplicate includes all pages, drawings, agents, abilities, and settings from the original.

## Deleting strategies

To permanently delete a strategy:

1. Right-click the strategy in your library
2. Select "Delete" from the context menu
3. Confirm the deletion in the dialog

<Warning>
  Deleting a strategy cannot be undone. All pages and associated images are permanently removed from your system.
