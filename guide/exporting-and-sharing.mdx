## Export format

Icarus strategies are exported as `.ica` files, which are ZIP archives containing:

- A JSON file with all strategy data (pages, drawings, agents, abilities, etc.)
- Image files referenced in the strategy
- Metadata including version number and map information

<Note>
  The `.ica` format is proprietary to Icarus but uses standard ZIP compression, making it lightweight and portable.
</Note>

## Exporting a single strategy

Share an individual strategy file:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open or select the strategy">
    Either open the strategy you want to export, or right-click it in your library.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose export">
    Select "Export" from the file menu or context menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose save location">
    A file picker opens. Choose where to save the `.ica` file and optionally rename it.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm export">
    The strategy is packaged with all its data and images, then saved to your chosen location.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Before exporting, Icarus automatically saves your strategy to ensure the export contains all recent changes.
</Tip>

## Exporting folders

Export multiple strategies at once by exporting an entire folder:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Right-click a folder">
    In your library, right-click the folder you want to export.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select export folder">
    Choose "Export Folder" from the context menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose save location">
    Select where to save the `.zip` file containing all strategies in the folder.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for completion">
    All strategies in the folder and its subfolders are packaged into individual `.ica` files, then bundled into a single ZIP archive.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The folder export preserves your folder structure:

- Each strategy becomes a `.ica` file
- Folders become directories in the ZIP
- Nested folders are preserved
- Duplicate folder names get numbered suffixes

<Warning>
  Large folders with many strategies and images can take significant time to export. The export process creates temporary files during packaging.
</Warning>

## File naming and sanitization

When exporting, Icarus sanitizes file names:

- Invalid characters (`< > : " / \ | ? *`) are replaced with underscores
- Empty names become "untitled"
- Duplicate names in the same export get numbered suffixes

This ensures exported files work across all operating systems.

## Sharing strategies

Once exported, share your `.ica` files with teammates:

- **Direct file sharing**: Send via Discord, email, cloud storage, or USB drive
- **Team drives**: Store in shared folders like Google Drive or Dropbox
- **Version control**: Track changes to strategies in Git (though binary diffs are not meaningful)

## Legacy format support

Icarus maintains backward compatibility:

- Old strategies without the pages system are automatically migrated on import
- Legacy image embedding is converted to the modern file-based system
- Version numbers track format changes
- Strategies from older Icarus versions open seamlessly

<Note>
  The current version number is stored in `Settings.versionNumber`. Strategies are migrated to the latest version when opened.
</Note>

## Export data structure

The JSON inside an `.ica` file contains:

```json
{
  "versionNumber": "42",
  "mapData": "Ascent",
  "pages": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-here",
      "sortIndex": "0",
      "name": "Page 1",
      "drawingData": [...],
      "agentData": [...],
      "abilityData": [...],
      "textData": [...],
      "imageData": [...],
      "utilityData": [...],
      "isAttack": "true",
      "settings": {...},
      "lineUpData": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Technical details

### Image handling

Images are stored efficiently:

- Original images are saved in the strategy's support directory
- Image IDs reference files, not embedded data (except on web)
- Unused images are cleaned up when loading strategies
- Export includes only referenced images

### ZIP structure

An exported `.ica` file contains:

```
strategy-name.ica
├── strategy-name.json (the main data)
├── image-uuid-1.png
├── image-uuid-2.jpg
└── (additional images...)
```

### Compression

The ZIP format provides:

- Efficient compression of JSON text data
- Already-compressed images stored without re-compression
- Fast random access to individual files
- Wide compatibility across platforms
