## Understanding pages

Each strategy can contain multiple pages that represent different stages or variations of your tactic. Pages work like slides in a presentation:

- Each page has its own set of agents, abilities, drawings, and utilities
- Pages are ordered sequentially with a sort index
- Only one page is active at a time
- Switching pages preserves all elements on each page

<Note>
  When you create a new strategy, it starts with a single page called "Page 1". The first page is set to attack side by default.
</Note>

## Adding pages

Create additional pages to show progression or variations:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the pages panel">
    Click the pages bar at the bottom of the screen to expand the full pages list.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add a new page">
    Click the `+` button in the pages panel. A new page is created with the next sequential number.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Customize the new page">
    The new page inherits settings and elements from the previous page, making it easy to show progression.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  New pages copy all elements from the last page in your strategy, giving you a starting point to build from.
</Tip>

## Navigating between pages

Switch between pages using multiple methods:

### Keyboard shortcuts

- **Forward (next page)**: Press `A`
- **Backward (previous page)**: Press `D`
- Navigation wraps around: going forward from the last page jumps to the first

### Pages panel

1. Expand the pages bar by clicking the arrow icon
2. Click any page in the list to switch to it
3. The active page is highlighted with a colored background

### Animated transitions

When switching pages, Icarus animates the transition:

- Elements that exist on both pages move smoothly to their new positions
- Elements only on the previous page fade out
- Elements only on the next page fade in
- The animation duration is 1 second

<Note>
  During page transitions, the main view is temporarily hidden while the animated overlay plays. This ensures smooth, flicker-free transitions.
</Note>

## Managing pages

### Renaming pages

Give your pages descriptive names:

1. Expand the pages panel
2. Click the edit icon next to any page
3. Enter a new name and press Enter
4. The name appears in the collapsed pages bar when that page is active

### Reordering pages

Change the sequence of your pages:

1. Expand the pages panel
2. Click and drag any page to a new position
3. The sort order updates automatically
4. Keyboard navigation follows the new order

<Tip>
  Use drag-and-drop reordering to adjust your strategy flow without recreating pages.
</Tip>

### Deleting pages

Remove pages you no longer need:

1. Expand the pages panel
2. Click the delete icon next to the page
3. Confirm the deletion in the dialog

<Warning>
  You cannot delete the last remaining page in a strategy. Every strategy must have at least one page. Deleted pages cannot be recovered.
</Warning>

If you delete the currently active page, Icarus automatically switches to the first page in the list.

## Page-specific settings

Each page stores its own configuration:

- **Attack/Defense side**: Toggle between attacker and defender perspective
- **Strategy settings**: Agent visibility, utility display preferences
- **All elements**: Agents, abilities, drawings, text, images, and utilities
- **Line-ups**: Associated position and ability line-up data

### Sharing settings between pages

Pages inherit settings when created but remain independent afterward. To apply settings across multiple pages:

1. Configure the first page as desired
2. Create new pages (they copy the previous page's settings)
3. Or manually update each existing page

## Working with page data

Pages are stored in the strategy file:

- Each page has a unique ID and sort index
- Page data is serialized to JSON for export
- Images are stored in a shared folder per strategy
- Switching pages flushes the current page to storage before loading the next

<Note>
  The coordinate system uses a 16:9 world space with normalized coordinates. Maps are centered with padding, and all element positions are transformed during migration.
