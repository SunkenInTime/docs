Icarus provides comprehensive strategy management including multi-page support, folder organization, and file import/export.

## Creating strategies

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new strategy">
    Click "New Strategy" and provide a name. A new strategy is created with:
    - A unique ID
    - One default page ("Page 1")
    - The Ascent map selected by default
    - Current timestamp for creation and last edited dates
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select your map">
    Choose the Valorant map for your strategy. The map can be changed later if needed.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set attack or defense">
    Toggle between attacking and defending side. This affects:
    - The default map view orientation
    - Spawn position context
    - Site labels (A/B/C)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Multi-page strategies

Each strategy can contain multiple pages to break down complex setups:

### Adding pages

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Page">
    Creates a new page with all elements from the current page copied over.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Name the page">
    Give it a descriptive name like "Initial Setup", "Post-plant", or "Retake".
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Modify the page">
    Edit agents, abilities, drawings, and lineups independently.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Navigating pages

Switch between pages using:

- **Arrow keys** - Navigate forward/backward through pages
- **Page list** - Click directly on the page you want to view
- **Keyboard shortcuts** - Use configured hotkeys for quick navigation

<Note>
  Pages are ordered by their `sortIndex`. You can reorder pages by dragging them in the page list.
</Note>

### Page transitions

When switching pages, Icarus animates the transition:

- Elements that move show smooth position changes
- New elements fade in
- Removed elements fade out
- Unchanged elements remain visible during the transition

## Auto-save

Icarus automatically saves your work:

- **Save timer** - Triggered after a configurable delay (default: a few seconds after edits)
- **Save indicator** - Shows "Saving..." while the save is in progress
- **Debouncing** - Multiple rapid edits are coalesced into a single save

<Warning>
  Auto-save only works for strategies that have been saved at least once. Unsaved strategies need to be manually saved first.
</Warning>

### Manual save

You can force an immediate save:

1. Use the Save button in the toolbar
2. Press the save keyboard shortcut
3. Export the strategy to a file

## Importing strategies

Icarus supports importing from `.ica` files:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select import method">
    - **File picker** - Browse and select an `.ica` file
    - **Drag and drop** - Drop files directly onto the app window
    - **File path** - Provide a direct path (useful for automation)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Load strategy data">
    Icarus reads the file and extracts:
    - Strategy metadata (name, map, creation date)
    - All pages with their content
    - Embedded images (if the file is a ZIP)
    - Version information for migration
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic migration">
    Legacy strategies are automatically upgraded to the current format, including:
    - Converting single-page strategies to multi-page
    - Migrating to 16:9 world coordinates
    - Updating ability positions if the version is outdated
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  ZIP-based `.ica` files (created by newer versions) include embedded images. Legacy JSON-only files will try to load images from a separate folder.
</Note>

## Exporting strategies

Export your strategies to share with teammates:

### Single strategy export

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Export">
    Choose "Export Strategy" from the menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select location">
    Pick where to save the `.ica` file.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="File is created">
    Icarus generates a ZIP archive containing:
    - Strategy JSON with all pages
    - All embedded images
    - Metadata and version information
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Folder export

You can export an entire folder:

1. All strategies in the folder are exported
2. Subfolders are included recursively
3. A single ZIP file contains the folder hierarchy

## Strategy operations

### Renaming

Change the strategy name anytime. The internal ID remains the same, ensuring references stay valid.

### Duplicating

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select duplicate">
    Right-click a strategy and choose "Duplicate".
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="New copy is created">
    A new strategy is created with:
    - New unique ID
    - All pages copied with new IDs
    - "(Copy)" appended to the name
    - Same folder location
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Deleting

Deleting a strategy:

- Removes it from the Hive database
- Deletes the strategy's storage folder (including images)
- Cannot be undone

<Warning>
  Strategy deletion is permanent. Consider exporting a backup before deleting important strategies.
</Warning>

## Version migration

Icarus includes automatic migration for older strategy files:

### Legacy data migration

Strategies created before multi-page support are converted:

1. Old flat data structure is wrapped into a single page
2. All drawings, agents, abilities, and text are moved to "Page 1"
3. Version number is updated to current

### World coordinate migration

Older strategies used 1.24:1 aspect ratio. Modern strategies use 16:9:

1. All positions are shifted horizontally to center the map
2. Drawings, agents, abilities, utilities, and lineups are adjusted
3. Bounding boxes are recalculated

<Note>
  Migration happens automatically when loading or switching pages. The updated strategy is saved immediately.
</Note>

## Storage structure

Strategies are stored in two places:

### Hive database

The main strategy data (metadata, pages, element positions) is stored in a local Hive database:

- Fast access for listing strategies
- Efficient querying for folder organization
- Atomic updates for reliability

### File system

Images and large media are stored in the application support directory:

```
<app_support>/
  <strategy_id>/
    images/
      <image_id>.<ext>
      ...
```

Unused images are cleaned up when loading a strategy.

## Best practices

<Tip>
  Use descriptive page names that indicate the round phase or scenario:
  - "Round Start - Default"
  - "Post-Plant - A Site"
  - "Retake - 3v4"
  - "Eco Round - B Split"
</Tip>

### Organization

- Group related strategies in folders
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Export important strategies regularly as backups
- Delete unused strategies to keep the library clean

### Performance

- Strategies with many pages may take longer to switch
- Large images increase file size
- Clean up unused lineups and images periodically
