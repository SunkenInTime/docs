Icarus lets you position Valorant agents and their abilities on the map to visualize team compositions and ability setups.

## Placing agents

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select an agent">
    Choose from the full Valorant agent roster. Agents are displayed with their character portraits.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click on the map">
    Place the agent at the desired position. The agent icon appears at that location.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Adjust position">
    Drag the agent to fine-tune placement. The position is tracked in normalized coordinates.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Agent states

Toggle between agent states:

- **Alive** - Default state, shows normal agent icon
- **Dead** - Marked with visual indicator (e.g., X or skull)

<Note>
  Agent state toggling is useful for planning retakes or post-death scenarios.
</Note>

## Placing abilities

Abilities can be placed to show skill usage:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select an ability">
    Choose from the agent's ability set:
    - Basic ability (E)
    - Signature ability (C/Q)
    - Ultimate ability (X)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Place on map">
    Click where the ability should be used or land.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Rotate if needed">
    Some abilities support rotation (walls, smokes, etc.). Drag to adjust angle and length.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Ability types

Different abilities have different visual representations:

- **Square abilities** - Fixed-size abilities like Sage's Healing Orb
- **Rotatable abilities** - Directional abilities like Viper's Poison Cloud
- **Line abilities** - Walls and barriers like Phoenix's Blaze

## Rotation and length

For abilities that support it:

### Rotating abilities

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the ability">
    Click on a placed ability to select it.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Drag to rotate">
    Move your mouse to adjust the angle. The ability rotates around its anchor point.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Adjust length">
    For line-based abilities, extend or shrink the visual representation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Rotation is tracked in radians internally. The UI shows a visual preview while dragging.
</Note>

### Anchor points

Abilities have specific anchor points for rotation:

- **Center anchored** - Rotate around the center of the ability
- **Edge anchored** - Rotate from one end (walls, etc.)

The anchor point is calculated based on ability size and map scale.

## Updating positions

Reposition agents and abilities by dragging:

1. **Drag to move** - Click and hold, then drag to a new position
2. **Out of bounds deletion** - If dragged outside the map, the element is removed
3. **Undo support** - Position changes are tracked in the action history

<Warning>
  Dragging an agent or ability outside the map boundaries automatically deletes it. Use undo if this was accidental.
</Warning>

## Removing agents and abilities

### Manual removal

- Select the element and press Delete
- Right-click and choose "Remove"
- Drag it off the map

### Undo/redo

All agent and ability actions support undo/redo:

- **Addition** - Undo removes the element, redo restores it
- **Position changes** - Undo/redo cycles through position history
- **Rotation changes** - Each rotation adjustment can be undone

## Switching sides

When you switch between attack and defense, agents and abilities are automatically flipped:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Toggle side">
    Click the "Switch Sides" button.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic mirroring">
    All agents and abilities are flipped:
    - X positions are mirrored horizontally
    - Y positions are mirrored vertically
    - Rotations are adjusted to maintain the same relative angles
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="History is preserved">
    Position history for undo/redo is also flipped, so you can still undo changes after switching sides.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Size customization

Agent and ability sizes can be adjusted:

### Agent size

Change how large agent icons appear on the map:

1. Open strategy settings
2. Adjust the "Agent Size" slider
3. All agents on the current page are resized

### Ability size

Similarly, ability icons can be resized:

1. Adjust the "Ability Size" slider
2. All abilities update immediately

<Note>
  Size settings are saved per strategy. Different strategies can use different icon sizes.
</Note>

## Action tracking

Every agent and ability action is logged:

### Action types

- **Addition** - Creating a new agent or ability
- **Deletion** - Removing an element
- **Edit** - Moving, rotating, or modifying an element

### Action groups

Actions are organized by type:

- `ActionGroup.agent` - All agent-related actions
- `ActionGroup.ability` - All ability-related actions

This enables selective undo/redo by action type.

## Data persistence

Agents and abilities are stored as JSON:

### Agent data

```json
{
  "type": "jett",
  "position": {"dx": 450.0, "dy": 320.0},
  "state": "alive",
  "id": "uuid-here"
}
```

### Ability data

```json
{
  "type": "jett",
  "abilityType": "smoke",
  "position": {"dx": 500.0, "dy": 400.0},
  "rotation": 1.57,
  "length": 50.0,
  "id": "uuid-here"
}
```

## Best practices

<Tip>
  Use different agent states to show sequencing:
  1. Place all agents alive for the initial setup
  2. Duplicate the page
  3. Mark casualties and show the adjusted positions
</Tip>

### Performance

- Limit the number of abilities on a single page for clarity
- Use rotation only when necessary (simpler abilities render faster)
- Remove unused agents and abilities before exporting

### Visual clarity

- Don't overlap agents and abilities unless showing stacking
- Use drawings to connect related elements (e.g., arrow from agent to ability target)
- Adjust icon sizes based on map complexity
