description: Organize strategies with folders, custom icons, and colors
---

Icarus provides a flexible folder system to keep your strategies organized. Create nested folders with custom icons and colors to build a structure that works for your team.

## Creating folders

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click New Folder">
    Open the folder creation dialog from the main menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Name the folder">
    Give it a descriptive name like "Pearl Strategies" or "Scrim Prep - Week 3".
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose an icon">
    Select from 30+ icons including:
    - Tactical symbols (flag, shield, sword)
    - Organization icons (folder, archive, dashboard)
    - Strategy icons (map, lightbulb, target)
    - Gaming icons (esports, controller)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Pick a color">
    Choose from preset colors:
    - Red
    - Blue
    - Green
    - Orange
    - Purple
    - Generic (gray)
    - Custom (pick any color)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Folder is created">
    The new folder appears in the current location (root or inside the active folder).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Folders can be nested infinitely. Create subfolders to organize strategies by map, agent comp, or any other criteria.
</Note>

## Folder hierarchy

Folders use a parent-child relationship:

- **Root folders** - Have no parent (`parentID` is null)
- **Subfolders** - Have a `parentID` pointing to their parent folder

### Navigating folders

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click a folder">
    Opens the folder and shows its contents (strategies and subfolders).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use breadcrumbs">
    The full folder path is displayed at the top. Click any folder in the path to jump there.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Go back">
    Click "Up" or the parent folder name to move up one level.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Organizing strategies

### Moving strategies to folders

<Steps>
  <Step title="Drag and drop">
    Drag a strategy from the list and drop it onto a folder.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Strategy is moved">
    The strategy's `folderID` is updated to the target folder.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Alternatively:

1. Right-click a strategy
2. Choose "Move to Folder"
3. Select the destination folder

### Moving strategies out of folders

Move a strategy back to the root:

1. Right-click the strategy
2. Choose "Move to Root"
3. The strategy's `folderID` is set to null

## Editing folders

Update folder properties:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Right-click the folder">
    Open the context menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose Edit Folder">
    The edit dialog opens.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update properties">
    Change:
    - Name
    - Icon
    - Color
    - Custom color (if using custom color mode)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save changes">
    The folder updates immediately in the UI.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deleting folders

Removing a folder also removes its contents:

<Warning>
  Deleting a folder permanently deletes all strategies inside it. This cannot be undone. Export important strategies before deleting their folder.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Right-click the folder">
    Open the context menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose Delete Folder">
    A confirmation dialog appears.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm deletion">
    All strategies in the folder are deleted:
    - Removed from the Hive database
    - Storage folders (images, etc.) are deleted
    - The folder itself is removed
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Recursive deletion

Deleting a folder deletes:

- All strategies directly in the folder
- All subfolders
- All strategies in all subfolders
- All associated files (images, etc.)

## Moving folders

Reorganize your folder structure:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Drag the folder">
    Drag a folder onto another folder to make it a subfolder.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Folder is moved">
    The `parentID` is updated to the new parent folder.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  You cannot move a folder into one of its own subfolders (circular reference prevention is not implemented, so be careful).
</Note>

## Exporting folders

Export an entire folder and its contents:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Right-click the folder">
    Choose "Export Folder".
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select save location">
    Pick where to save the ZIP file.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Folder is zipped">
    Icarus creates a ZIP containing:
    - All strategies in the folder (as `.ica` files)
    - All subfolders with their strategies
    - Images and media embedded in each strategy
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Folder export structure

The ZIP file mirrors the folder hierarchy:

```
Pearl_Strategies.zip
├── Pearl_Strategies/
│   ├── strategy1.ica
│   ├── strategy2.ica
│   ├── A_Site/
│   │   ├── a_site_execute.ica
│   │   └── a_site_retake.ica
│   └── B_Site/
│       ├── b_site_default.ica
│       └── b_site_fake.ica
```

## Icon and color options

### Available icons

Icarus includes 30+ icons:

- **Organization** - `folder_shared`, `folder_special`, `workspaces`, `category`, `library_books`, `archive`, `dashboard`
- **Strategy** - `map`, `place`, `explore`, `flag`, `outlined_flag`, `lightbulb`, `track_changes`, `timeline`
- **Tactical** - `sword`, `shield`, `military_tech`, `security`, `bolt`
- **Gaming** - `sports_esports`, `psychology`
- **General** - `star`, `snowflake`, `bug`, `cake`, `code`, `shopping_cart`, `api`

### Color presets

- **Red** - `Colors.red`
- **Blue** - `Colors.blue`
- **Green** - `Colors.green`
- **Orange** - `Colors.orange`
- **Purple** - `Colors.purple`
- **Generic** - Gray from theme
- **Custom** - Any RGB color

## Folder metadata

Each folder stores:

```dart
class Folder {
  String name;
  String id;              // Unique UUID
  DateTime dateCreated;
  String? parentID;       // null for root folders
  IconData icon;
  FolderColor color;
  Color? customColor;     // Used if color == FolderColor.custom
}
```

## Best practices

<Tip>
  Organize folders by:
  - **Map** - "Ascent", "Bind", "Icebox", etc.
  - **Agent comp** - "Jett Dash", "Viper Smokes", etc.
  - **Round type** - "Eco", "Full Buy", "Anti-Eco"
  - **Scenario** - "Post-Plant", "Retake", "Default"
</Tip>

### Naming conventions

Use consistent naming:

- Start with the map name: "Ascent - A Site Executes"
- Include the side: "Bind - Defense Setups"
- Use dates for scrims: "Scrim Prep - 2024-01-15"

### Color coding

Develop a color system:

- **Red** - Attacking strategies
- **Blue** - Defending strategies
- **Green** - Eco rounds
- **Orange** - Experimental setups
- **Purple** - Tournament-ready strategies

### Folder depth

Keep folder nesting reasonable:

- **Good**: `Ascent > Attack > A Site > Executes`
- **Too deep**: `Maps > Ascent > Attack > A Site > Executes > Jett Dash > Week 3`

Aim for 2-3 levels maximum for quick navigation.

## Performance considerations

- Folders are loaded from Hive on startup
- Large folder hierarchies may take longer to render
- Folder icons are Flutter Material icons (no network requests)
- Folder colors are stored as enums (efficient storage)

## Searching and filtering

While Icarus doesn't have built-in search (as of now), you can:

- Use descriptive folder names for quick visual scanning
- Organize chronologically (newest first) within folders
- Export folders to ZIP and use your OS's search functionality
