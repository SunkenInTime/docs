# Quickstart

This guide walks you through creating your first strategy in Icarus, from downloading the app to saving your completed strategy.

## Download and install

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Icarus from the Microsoft Store">
    Download Icarus from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PBWHHZRQFW6?hl=en-us&gl=US&ocid=pdpshare).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Launch the app">
    Once installed, launch Icarus from your Start menu. The app will initialize local storage and display the folder navigator interface.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create your first strategy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Create Strategy">
    From the main folder navigator screen, click the **Create Strategy** button in the top-right toolbar.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Name your strategy">
    Enter a descriptive name for your strategy in the dialog (e.g., "Haven A Site Execute"). Click **Create** or press Enter to continue.
    
    <Note>
      Strategy names can be changed later by right-clicking the strategy in your library and selecting **Rename**.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select a map">
    Your strategy opens on the default map (Ascent). To change maps, click the **Map Selector** in the top toolbar and choose from available Valorant maps including Bind, Haven, Split, Icebox, Breeze, Fracture, Pearl, Lotus, Sunset, and Abyss.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Draw on the map

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select drawing tools">
    In the right sidebar, you'll find the **Drawing Tools** section with options for:
    - **Color**: Choose from preset colors for your lines
    - **Stroke**: Toggle between solid and dotted lines
    - **Arrow**: Add arrows to show movement direction
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Draw on the map">
    Click and drag on the map to create freehand drawings. Hold shift while drawing to create straight lines between two points.
    
    <Tip>
      Use the pen tool for movement paths and the arrow option to indicate direction. Dotted lines work well for optional or alternative paths.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add agents">
    Scroll down in the sidebar to the **Agents** section. Drag agent icons onto the map to position them. You can:
    - Filter agents by role (Duelist, Controller, Initiator, Sentinel)
    - Resize agents by clicking and dragging the corners
    - Rotate agents by dragging the rotation handle
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Place abilities">
    Select an agent to view their abilities in the sidebar. Drag ability icons onto the map to show utility placement like smokes, walls, or flashes.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add text and annotations">
    Use the **Text** tool in the sidebar to add labels, callouts, or strategy notes directly on the map. Click to place text, then type your content.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Save and organize

<Steps>
  <Step title="Auto-save is enabled">
    Icarus automatically saves your work as you create. Changes are persisted to Hive local storage after a brief delay when you stop editing.
    
    <Note>
      You can see the save indicator in the top-left when auto-save triggers. To manually save, use the **Save** button or keyboard shortcut.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Return to library">
    Click the **Home** icon in the top-left to return to the folder navigator. Your strategy is now saved in your library.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Organize with folders (optional)">
    Back in the folder navigator:
    1. Click **Add Folder** to create organization folders
    2. Drag your strategy into folders to keep them organized
    3. Create nested folders for team compositions, maps, or site strategies
  </Step>
</Steps>
