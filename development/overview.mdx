description: Introduction to Icarus development and contribution
---

Icarus is an interactive strategy creation tool for Valorant players built with Flutter. It focuses on a robust map drawing system that lets teams create, save, and iterate on strategies locally.

## Tech Stack

Icarus is built with modern Flutter technologies:

- **Flutter**: Cross-platform UI framework
- **Riverpod**: State management
- **Hive**: Local NoSQL database for storing strategies
- **Shadcn UI**: Component library for consistent UI

## Core Features

- Interactive map drawing and annotations
- Save, load, and organize strategies locally
- Agent and ability helpers for Valorant characters
- Desktop-focused UX for planning sessions
- Multi-page strategy support
- Export/import strategies as `.ica` files

## Project Structure

The codebase is organized as follows:

```
lib/
├── main.dart                 # App bootstrap and initialization
├── providers/                # Riverpod state management
│   ├── strategy_provider.dart
│   ├── folder_provider.dart
│   ├── drawing_provider.dart
│   └── ...
├── widgets/                  # Reusable UI components
├── const/                    # Constants and configurations
│   ├── hive_boxes.dart      # Hive box definitions
│   └── settings.dart        # App settings
├── hive/                     # Hive adapters and models
│   └── hive_registrar.g.dart
└── strategy_view.dart       # Main strategy editing screen
```

## Key Concepts

### Strategies

Strategies are the core data model in Icarus. Each strategy contains:
- Multiple pages for different phases of a plan
- Drawing elements (lines, free-form drawings)
- Placed agents and abilities
- Text annotations and images
- Map selection and attack/defend side

### Folders

Strategies are organized in a hierarchical folder structure, similar to a file system. Folders can be nested and customized with icons and colors.

### State Management

Icarus uses Riverpod providers for state management. Key providers include:
- `strategyProvider` - Manages current strategy and persistence
- `folderProvider` - Manages folder hierarchy
- `drawingProvider` - Canvas drawing state
- `agentProvider`, `abilityProvider` - Placed game elements

## Development Requirements

- Flutter SDK 3.38.4 (via FVM)
- Dart >= 3.4.3
- Platform-specific build tools (see Setup)
