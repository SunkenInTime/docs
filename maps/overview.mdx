## How Maps Work in Icarus

Maps are the foundation of strategy creation in Icarus. Each Valorant map is represented with high-fidelity SVG assets that include multiple layers for different views and information.

## Map Components

Every map in Icarus includes several asset layers:

- **Base Map** - The core map layout showing the terrain and structure
- **Callouts** - Location names and callout positions
- **Spawn Walls** - Barrier locations at round start
- **Ult Orbs** - Ultimate orb spawn locations
- **Attack/Defense Views** - Separate perspectives for each side

## Map Selection

When creating strategies, you can:

1. Select any map from the available rotation
2. Choose between Attack and Defense perspectives
3. Switch between sides using the sword/shield toggle
4. Access maps that are out of rotation for legacy strategies

## Map Scaling

Each map has a custom scale factor to ensure consistent strategy visualization across different map sizes:

```dart
MapValue.ascent: 1.0
MapValue.breeze: 1.02
MapValue.lotus: 1.25
MapValue.icebox: 1.05
MapValue.split: 1.18
MapValue.haven: 1.09
MapValue.fracture: 1.0
MapValue.pearl: 1.185
MapValue.abyss: 1.167
MapValue.sunset: 1.048
MapValue.bind: 0.835
MapValue.corrode: 0.985
```

## Interactive Features

On the map canvas, you can:

- **Zoom and Pan** - Navigate the map with mouse controls
- **Place Agents** - Drag agent icons onto positions
- **Draw Utilities** - Add ability lineups and utility usage
- **Add Annotations** - Insert text, images, and custom drawings
- **Layer Elements** - Combine multiple elements for complex strategies

## Map Rotation

Icarus tracks which maps are currently in the competitive rotation versus those that are out of play. This helps you focus on relevant maps while maintaining access to legacy content.

### Currently Available

Maps in the current rotation are prominently displayed in the map selector.

### Out of Rotation

Maps that have been removed from competitive play are grouped separately but remain accessible for viewing historical strategies.

## Technical Details

Maps are stored as SVG assets in the `assets/maps/` directory with the following naming convention:

- `{mapname}_map.svg` - Attack side base map
- `{mapname}_map_defense.svg` - Defense side base map  
- `{mapname}_call_outs.svg` - Attack side callouts
- `{mapname}_call_outs_defense.svg` - Defense side callouts
- `{mapname}_spawn_walls.svg` - Barrier locations
- `{mapname}_ult_orbs.svg` - Ultimate orb positions
- `thumbnails/{mapname}_thumbnail.webp` - Map preview image
