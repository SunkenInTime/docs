## First launch

When you first launch Icarus, the app will:

1. Initialize local storage in your application support directory
2. Set up Hive databases for strategies and folders
3. Display the main folder navigator interface

You're now ready to [create your first strategy](/quickstart).

## Importing existing strategies

If you or your teammates have existing Icarus strategy files (`.ica` format), you can import them:

1. Click the **Import .ica** button in the top toolbar
2. Select your `.ica` file from the file picker
3. The strategy will be loaded and ready to view or edit

<Note>
  The `.ica` file format is Icarus's native strategy export format, allowing you to share strategies between computers or with teammates.
